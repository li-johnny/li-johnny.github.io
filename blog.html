            <h2>First Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of my trouble during this assignment was learning about the limitations of HTML without using CSS. 
                                Realizing that HTML is just a glorified print function quickly led me to finding ways to implement CSS. 
                                Since I didn't particularly understand CSS, I looked around for features I wanted added and picked 
                                code from around the internet to implement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned that HTML is a very limited language in terms of capabilities. It operates in a way 
                                that is essentially organizational print statements, but now on a webpage instead of a terminal. However, most of what I
                                learned along the way was how to separate and link files between CSS and HTML. That and yoinking CSS styles off of the internet 
                                and throwing them on to this website. :)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used a lot of W3school and GeeksforGeeks's guides and code and tweaked some things around until I made some functioning 
                                lines of code. This definitely is not the cleanest code, but the resources were helpful in aiding me to write functional code that
                                has made me somewhat more confident in my web development knowledge.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Second Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The filter was by far the most challenging part of the assignment, the countless hours of messing with position and
                                display functions to make the input box and text inline with each other was traumatic. Eventually, I got on the right track
                                and ended up using a flexbox to line everything up. Albeit, it took a trip to Frank for some CSS hours help, but I was on 
                                the right track and that's what really matters. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned that CSS requires heavy specificity in order to best manage everything. Alongside learning many new functions 
                                in CSS, recognizing which selectors to modify and the level of depth in their tree to modify was an insightful experience 
                                in applying my CSS knowledge. Prior to this, I had no insights or experience with CSS and everything I did, I was learning 
                                for the first time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used a lot of W3school and went to Frank for office hours. While online resources gave a general guide/refresher to the 
                                function content, when it came to issue in applying that knowledge, I found TAs to be the more helpful correcting my knowledge. 
                                Many of the functions I used were learned on-hand and online in completing this assignment, and with TAs were two of the most 
                                helpful recourses for completing my assignment.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I googled almost every part of this assignment, many of the functions I used I had not remembered where or how 
                                to apply them, making Google a very helpful resource throughout this assignment. I spent a majority of the time 
                                googling how to make an input box and text, inline with each other before realizing display flex was the move. Then 
                                googling how to use drop shadows was one of the final parts of this assignment that soaked up a majority of my time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Third Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The filter truly is the bane of my existence, not only did it haunt me in the second assignment, but it came back with vengeance in the third. 
                                I could not have done this without Frank's help, there is no doubt in my mind other than my ability to complete this assignment on my own, 
                                the amount of logical errors in creating the filter were some of the most challenging bits about this assignment. Trying to pull text from elements 
                                were one of the most challenging bits about this assignment, however, in hindsight, I wish that I had wrote out my logic from start to end prior to beginning. 
                                In solving my logical errors, many were often flipping variables or removing unnecessary logical operators. In the end, I managed to repair my filter, or at least 
                                I hope I did, I'm not the best with test cases, but they've properly shown the correct corresponding filters selected so far. I give credit to Frank again for 
                                setting the logic straight from my initial thought process from utilizing a mix of true/false to append the match filters to now only appending if 
                                all elements are true.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned how bad I am at JavaScript and how much I lack the general knowledge of functions to complete this assignment effectively. 
                                While my code is very much spaghetti, I dislike how I used chains of if statements and if I were to do it again, I'd wanted to go in 
                                a different method. However, the process was very much enlightening in not only how limited my skills were, but also how unfamiliar 
                                I am with JavaScript logic. Albeit, I did enjoy making variable declarations without a care for datatype in mind. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just like last time, Frank was a real one, but also Emmanuel as well. I would not have had a chance at this assignment if it were not for the TAs' 
                                guidance in this assignment. While reviewing the course videos, it helps to have a TA offer advice on the code at hand as I completed the assignment 
                                or at least made my way through it. Other than TAs, having MDN, W3school, and GeeksforGeeks were among the most helpful resources in every part of the assignment 
                                from creating/adding posts to filtering through the posts. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I thought I googled alot last assignment, but this time really takes the cake. The sheer amount of googling in order for 
                                me to complete this assignment was astounding. I think it has much to do with the holes in my knowledge that was self-done 
                                (it's not you, it's me...) because the number of functions this required went way over my head. If I were to do this assignment without google 
                                I can assure you I would not have been pretty. Googling how to append children and utilize query selector took the most amount of time in trying 
                                to create a somewhat readable javascript program.  
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Fourth Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The directions were the most confusing part for me in that without the lesson, I would have been so confused as to what I specifically needed 
                                to create. In the end, after realizing it's just chaining if statements to respond with requests from the client to give it the files it wants 
                                from /public, I was able to make a workable code. My main challenge/issue was running this code on the school server which took forever to load, 
                                in the end, Frank, opened my eyes to running it on localhost, but also the proper command to launch a node program in powershell. Using ".\" is 
                                more confusing than I had imagined to run a node.js program.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I knew nothing coming into this assignment other than my previous work with JavaScript on the last assignment. While I was not planning on 
                                using synchronous functions for this assignment, the amount of time I wasted waiting for the school server to load the webpage was testing 
                                my patience... In the end, I learned that localhost was by far better and that the time I spent on using synchronous functions was not worth 
                                modifying my code to convert it into asynchronous functions. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frank continues to be my saviour, that and the recorded lectures to reestablish my knowledge were the most helpful in completing the assignment. 
                                Prior to office hours, I used MDN and GeeksforGeeks to browse for suitable functions to create the code for this program, but other than that, the 
                                office hours were by far the most helpful.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For this assignment, googling what each and every function does will continue to be my only method of completing assignments. Browsing through fs 
                                functions to read the files, while it looked simple on the surface, the options part was confusing, even though it was unnecessary for this assignment. 
                                Another part I googled was figuring out where to place the res.end() in the function, but also how "utf8" works as I ended up encoding everything 
                                which led to some issues later but were also fixed in time. 
                            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some challenges with the assignment was just remembering which modules to install when moving across devices. I work across three computers 
                                and working locally, especially with the need to have local file paths was a challenge to keep maintaining. One bigger issue I found was how 
                                picky Windows can be with using spaces in PC names which can cause it to not work without quotes around the file path. Luckily I was able to 
                                rememdy the situation with the aid of Frank :)

                        <ul>
                            <li>Much like with the last assignment, I only came in with the knowledge of previous assignments and nothing else. Learning how to use and apply handlebars 
                                was an interesting experience that I found to be both challenging and fun to play with file IO to generate templates. I definitely gained a much greater 
                                understanding in using handlebars and server side functions through this assignment and learned much more than I had expected.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Frank. The main resources I used for this assignment were mostly both the lecture content and Frank. For this assignment I feel like I didn't need 
                                to explore too far outside of my capabilities as most of the framework was laid out and it was just customizing to other content from there on out.

                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>For this assignment, I mostly had to google npm for both the scripts and to explore some possible packages, although I never did never use any special ones. 
                                Aside from that, I did Google around to learn more about handlebars and how to fragment them in the view folder along with the video to guide my process.
