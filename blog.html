                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of my trouble during this assignment was learning about the limitations of HTML without using CSS. 
                                Realizing that HTML is just a glorified print function quickly led me to finding ways to implement CSS. 
                                Since I didn't particularly understand CSS, I looked around for features I wanted to added and picked 
                                code from around the internet to implement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned that HTML is a very limited language in terms of capabilities. It operates in a way 
                                that is essentially organizational print statements, but now on a webpage instead of a terminal. However, most of what I
                                learned along the way was how to seperate and link files between CSS and HTML. That and yoinking CSS styles off of the internet 
                                and throwing them on to this website. :)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used a lot of W3school and GeeksforGeeks's guides and code and tweaked some things around until I made some functioning 
                                lines of code. It definitely is not the cleanest code, but the resources were helpful in aiding me to write functional code 
                                I can feel more confident in my web development knowledge.
