            <h2>First Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of my trouble during this assignment was learning about the limitations of HTML without using CSS. 
                                Realizing that HTML is just a glorified print function quickly led me to finding ways to implement CSS. 
                                Since I didn't particularly understand CSS, I looked around for features I wanted added and picked 
                                code from around the internet to implement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned that HTML is a very limited language in terms of capabilities. It operates in a way 
                                that is essentially organizational print statements, but now on a webpage instead of a terminal. However, most of what I
                                learned along the way was how to separate and link files between CSS and HTML. That and yoinking CSS styles off of the internet 
                                and throwing them on to this website. :)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used a lot of W3school and GeeksforGeeks's guides and code and tweaked some things around until I made some functioning 
                                lines of code. This definitely is not the cleanest code, but the resources were helpful in aiding me to write functional code that
                                has made me somewhat more confident in my web development knowledge.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Second Entry</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The filter was by far the most challenging part of the assignment, the countless hours of messing with position and
                                display functions to make the input box and text inline with each other was traumatic. Eventually, I got on the right track
                                and ended up using a flexbox to line everything up. Albeit, it took a trip to Frank for some CSS hours help, but I was on 
                                the right track and that's what really matters. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned that CSS requires heavy specificity in order to best manage everything. Alongside learning many new functions 
                                in CSS, recognizing which selectors to modify and the level of depth in their tree to modify was an insightful experience 
                                in applying my CSS knowledge. Prior to this, I had no insights or experience with CSS and everything I did, I was learning 
                                for the first time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used a lot of W3school and went to Frank for office hours. While online resources gave a general guide/refresher to the 
                                function content, when it came to issue in applying that knowledge, I found TAs to be the more helpful correcting my knowledge. 
                                Many of the functions I used were learned on-hand and online in completing this assignment, and with TAs were two of the most 
                                helpful recourses for completing my assignment.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I googled almost every part of this assignment, many of the functions I used I had not remembered where or how 
                                to apply them, making Google a very helpful resource throughout this assignment. I spent a majority of the time 
                                googling how to make an input box and text, inline with each other before realizing display flex was the move. Then 
                                googling how to use drop shadows was one of the final parts of this assignment that soaked up a majority of my time.
